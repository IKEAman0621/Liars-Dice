This is the start of a small game in C# using TCP to create the game "Liar's dice" online using TCP. Liars dice is a multiplayer game where each player is assigned 5 dice that the other players can't see. 
The object of the game is to bid on the sum of all dice. 
You make two statements, how many and of what kind.
A bet is valid if it has a fewer or equal amount of dice than the sum of ALL dice.
The players take turns, each player gets two choices:
  -Make a higher bid.
  -Call out an invalid bid.

A higher bid is in relation to the amount, not the dice value.
E.g you can bid four fives, and then five fours, but not the other way around.

The project is in windows forms, and is as a school project.
Thanks for reading, this will probably be updated later, and have fun!
